A critical piece in data-driven music industry movement is a retrospective look at success in the music industry. \n",
    "\n",
    "By analyzing datasets such as the tracks on the Billboard Top 100, industry leaders can have a clear understanding of relative market size, segmentation, and characteristics of successful music. Though the dataset in question only contains information for the year 2000, the methods used can be extended to use the exact same analyses to look for trends that may exist over the year. \n",
    "\n",
    "A good starting point in exploratory data analysis exercise, is to take a quantitative variable of interest and observe its distribution by segment. In the figure below we can see the distribution of number of weeks on the Billboard Charts, segmented by genre. This illustration demonstrated that the \"typical\" song (as judged by mean or median weeks) stays on the charts between 15 and 20 weeks. Of the better represented genres, Rock and Country tracks tend to maintain chart position for longer than Rap and R&B tracks. Otherwise, these distributions are as-expected. The right-skew that we observe is characteristic for variables with a natural lower-bound cutoff (e.g., no track can be on the charts for a negative number of weeks). \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"weeks_on_chart.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "We can compare our observations to the second chart, below, which similarly shows distribution by genre, but for ^peak^ rank. Again we observe the expected slight right skew, because peak rank is bounded by chart ranks of 1 and 100, and the metric is biased toward the lowest possible rank for each instance. As we might have guessed from inspecting the previous figure, the Rock category seems to best dominate the charts, followed by country, and then by the similarly-performing Rap and R&B categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting observation from peak rank is that \"winning\" tracks do not all necessarily shoot to the top of the charts. In fact, it seems just as likely for a popular song to enter the Billboard charts nad peak at a relatively unremarkable rank as it is for one to shoot to the top quartile. This is an interesting observation in light of winner-take-all notions of business, because it demonstrates that a top track is not characteristically the same as \"the\" top track. Otherwise said, not all of the popular songs spend time at the top of the list. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"peak_rank.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting next step would be to explore the business drivers of success in the music industry. It would be great to use the data as a first step to exploring the business decisions that affect Billboard Chart success. This information could be enormously useful. \n",
    "\n",
    "On that note, perhaps theres a link between entering the charts and climbing the charts. We can explore this idea by looking at a scatterplot that plots Peak Rank and Weeks on Chart. The scaterplot below shows this relationship. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"scatter.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspection yields a pretty strong relationship between the two metrics of success. The tracks with the better (lower) peak rank tend to have longer duration on the Billboard charts. This information is unsurprising but important. An interesting figment of this plot is that there are an alarmingly large number of tracks with exactly 20 weeks on the Billboard Charts. As a next step, I would certainly explore why this occurred. It's a sign of a possible flaw in our data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in exploratory data analysis it's important to not only report interesting findings, but also interesting questions that happened to not yield interesting results. This allows our constitutency to explore the idea for themselves without wasting time on the analysis and data work. Below we see a distribution of track length (colored by genre). This histogram is unsurprising. There are no obvious or important differences between genre and track length, and the observed gaussian distribution is unsurprising as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"track_len.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The music industry has the potential to be important consumers of information, and use this information to drive good business practices. The danger, is in the tension of artistic freedom and A&R direction for music. While it's nice to be data driven in business, the industry decision-makers must be vigilant to insights in the right way, so as not to dilute the music that makes it to market. \n",
